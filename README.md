# Rotater
A Fabric mod that adds the rotater.

Any rotation speed except 0 is supported. Currently, the only way to get a rotater to rotate at anything other than the default speed is to use `/give rotater:rotater{BlockEntityTag:{Speed: [speed] }}` or `/setblock ~ ~ ~ rotater:rotater{Speed: [speed] }`.

The rotater is also craftable. The recipe is four pistons around a potato. A rotater crafted this way will rotate at the default speed, 0.05F.

Finally, the rotater is waterloggable. The waterlogging works like with any vanilla block.
